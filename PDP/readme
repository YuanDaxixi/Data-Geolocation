Here are some bad news:

1: struct.calcsize('L') get 4 bytes on win7 but 8 bytes on centos7.0,
   so naively modify 'L' to 'I' on centos7 though it may cause bug,
   nearly each *.py file includes 'L', remember to modify them all.

2: the ip address is default set to 127.0.0.1, so modify it when 
   deploy it in sockaddr.py.
   
3: install pycrypto before run it.

4: I used several global variable, it cause some disgusting bug which has been solved,
   but the sulotion looks ugly...(naively set them empty before next use) 

*: the code is not elegant, just bear it.
   if I can remember something, I'll add it above
